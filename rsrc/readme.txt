The ZIP archive zoneinfo.zip is offered as a fallback for systems (such as Windows) that do no have their own copy of this data. Note that it is highly recommended that you use such a OS maintained dataset, as this data is changed (being added to) each year.

This copy was created on an up to data macOS (darwin) machine using the command

  zip -r zoneinfo.zip zoneinfo

from the standard location /usr/share

Symbolic links are duplicated.

This dataset is used by ZTimezone.
